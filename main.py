'''
WHAT IS SQLALCHEMY?
SQLAlchemy is a ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Python. It can be used to interact directly with a database to build tables, work with records, and execute SQL queries.

WHAT IS FLASK?:
Flask is a web framework for building web applications in Python. It can be used to create APIs.

WHAT IS MARSHMALLLOW?:
Marshmallow is a Python library for object serialization and deserialization. It also ensures that data matches schema specifications prior to accepting it.

WHAT IS SERIALIZATION & DESERIALIZATION?
Serialization means converting an object into an easily transferrable format.
Deserialization is when we convert it from that format back into an object.

WHAT IS A SCHEMA?
A schema defines the structure of a database. It specifies what tables will exist in the database, what fields those tables will have, what datatypes each field will have
and what relationships will exist between each table. It also defines constraints, such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and FOREIGN KEY.

There are three major components to this application:
- Models
- Schemas
- API Routes

Databases are the highest level structure. They can contain multiple schemas, views, and tables.
Schemas organize related database objects and contain tables.
Tables represent entities (models), which in this case are built from Python classes.

#====================== MODELS ==============================================
'''
Each model represents a different table in the database.
Each model attribute represents a column in the table.

This only includes foreign keys, so we don't need to create a complicated class model for it.

#============================ SCHEMAS ==================================
'''
A schema a collection of database objects, such as tables and views.
The schema describes the structure of the data and how the various tables and fields relate to one another.

We use schemas for:
- Validation: When people send us information we have to ensure it's valid & complete information.
- Serialization: Converting our Python objects into JSON.
- Deserialization: Translating JSON objects into a Python usable object or dictionary.

By using a schema we can automatically serialize objects.
